Ok, I'm making a mess of things.

A few days I ago I submitted my Thinkful resume assignment (4.12.3[33.3] "Resume project").
As I awaited its approval I proceeded with Thinkful coursework (4.12.4[33.4] "Buildind a LinkedIn Profile").  I was advised by the Thinkful lesson itself, however, not to proceed with the next step (4.12.5[33.5] "LinkedIn Project") until the resume had been approved by the human reviewer.

It was not approved.  Among several changes I need to make is the insertion of active links to various projects.  Of the four or so larger Thinkful projects so far, only two will run as-is from GitHub Pages.  These are the same two whose GitHub Pages were required at time of submission:  `Decoder-ring` and `Hotel-reservations`.  I thought this might be a good time to get the others working as well.  I decided to start with `Flashcard-app`.

All it rendered was a blank page.  I saw that it did not have an `index.html` page in its root directory.  Not having any better solutions to this, I created a new file in /(root) named `index.html`.  Into it I pasted content taken directly from `/public/index.html`.  Still just a blank page.

I added a homepage attribute to `package.json`.

I installed the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency by running
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

I updated scripts in `package.json`:
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",

I ran
npm run deploy

I configured my "GitHub Page" to use my `gh-pages` branch


Still nothing.  Not a clue what to do next.

I am unclear on what from my local directory gets pushed to the remote repo?  Everything?  If not, why not?

During the writing of code, when I would run `npm start`, CRA would run the React app in development mode on localhost:3000, and backend API on localhost:8080.

Additions to the Flashcard collection would be saved and incorporated into the code itself (i.e. the data object).

If I get Flashcard-app running on a "GitHub Page", where, if anywhere at all, will saves occur?

Suspending this project until I can speak with mentor.

---------------------------------------

Daniel helped me get my GitHub page "running."
We walked through a few of the steps listed in the README.md file at https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages
We redeployed from the terminal.
We may have done some other things as well.
Anyhow, now you can see content render at https://craig-r-kelly.github.io/Flashcard-app/
...but it's trying to use localhost:8080, and the console is full of errors.

Daniel said next I need to change the environmental variable.
But also, he suggested we place this on the back burner for now.  
I concur.
